In this scenario, we will use T-SQL variables to calculate and update loyalty points for customers based on their purchase history. 
The calculation will be based on the total amount spent by the customer in a given year, 
with a simple point system where 1 point is awarded for every $10 spent.

This example demonstrates how T-SQL variables can be used for more complex calculations 
involving data from multiple tables, and how these results can be used to update records in a database, 
showcasing the power and versatility of SQL in handling real-world business scenarios.
